# Boston-Housing-Predictor
Train a regression model to predict median house prices using the first 70% of data (older houses). Evaluate the model on the last 30% (newer houses). Compare results to a random split baseline. Analyze why performance may differ across the two splits. Suggest ways to improve robustness to temporal changes.
